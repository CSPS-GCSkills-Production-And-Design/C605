			<h2>Comparing Both Types of Pay Stub</h2>
			<h3>A few words on Pay fluctuations</h3>
			<p>You just received your pay, and it is higher than usual … are you entitled to this?</p>
			<p>Here are a few circumstances that might affect the amount you receive!</p>

			<p><strong>I heard there was a “big pay” twice a year…</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Indeed. You usually receive 2 pays per month, and monthly deductions for Union, Death Benefits, Disability Insurance, and  Medical Insurance are split over these 2 pays.</li>
				<li><strong>However, typically twice a year, there are 3 pay periods in a month!</strong></li>
				<li>During those months, Union and other Insurances will only be deducted on the second and third pay, so your first monthly pay will be higher!</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> statutory deductions (income tax, <abbr>CPP</abbr> or <abbr>QPP</abbr>, <abbr>EI</abbr>, <abbr>QPIP</abbr>) will still be deducted on these pays. </p>

			<p><strong>Any other good news?</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Yes! Each year, your salary increases because of a <strong>pay revision</strong> which is part of your Collective Agreement. Each Collective Agreement has a set date for yearly pay revisions.</li>
				<li>For example, for the PA group, the rate of pay increases on June 21*.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>*Note:</strong> if the collective agreement has expired, the rates will be revised retroactively, once a new agreement is signed. </p>
			<p>Collective agreements are available on the page entitled: <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/index-eng.aspx" target="_blank">“Collective agreements for public service”</a></p>

			<p><strong>More good news!</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You could be entitled to receive a salary increase on the anniversary date you were appointed at your current position. This salary increase is referred to as a Step in your Collective Agreement.</li>
				<li>If you have already reached the last step for your group and level, this will not apply and you remain at that last step.</li>
				<li>For example, if for example if you are a PM-1 and are already paid at Step 4, your salary would remain at that step.</li>
