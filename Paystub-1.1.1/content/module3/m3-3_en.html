			<h2>Comparing Both Types of Pay Stub</h2>
      <h3>Leave Without Pay</h3>
      <p>
        As seen in the previous lessons, if you were absent on Leave without Pay
        (LWOP) for 5 consecutive days or less, both pay stubs will indicate the
        number of hours and amount deducted from your pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, only the CWA Pay Stub will also indicate the Pay Period in
        which the LWOP actually occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s see an example on how this information would be displayed on your
        pay stubs.

      <p><strong>Now why not just reduce the number of hours being paid instead of using
			separate lines of Basic (or Acting) Pay for LWOP deductions?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Well, as the Pay System is automated, by default you are automatically
        paid for your regular work schedule (full-time or part-time regular
        hours). This is displayed on the first Basic (or Acting) Pay line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, the deduction for your hours of LWOP has to be made on
        different lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, as you can notice on the above example, there usually is a
        gap between the period covered by your pay, and the pay period during
        which the LWOP occurred. On the above, the pay covers August 9 to 22,
        while the LWOP took place in July.
