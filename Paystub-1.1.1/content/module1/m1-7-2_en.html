			<h2>Entitlements and Deductions – Leave Without Pay</h2>
			<p>Leave Without Pay (LWOP) is an unpaid temporary absence from work.</p>
			<p>For example, if you are a casual and do not report to work in case of sickness, the days you did not report to work will be recovered from your pay. The recovery of Leave Without Pay will appear in the Entitlements and Deductions section of your CWA Pay Stub.</p>
			<h3>If a period of Leave Without Pay (LWOP) of 5 consecutive days or less has been approved in Phoenix, it will appear twice in the Entitlements and Deductions Section:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>once as <abbr>LWOP</abbr><br>
					(this line only confirms the <abbr>LWOP</abbr> has taken place and appears for Pension calculation purposes)</li>
				<li>once as a basic pay (or acting pay) line with a negative amount which is deducted from your pay</li>
